## Challenges
001 | Multiples of 3 or 5 | [My Java solution](./java/src/Script001.java)
```
/*
 * If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we
 * get 3, 5, 6 and 9.  The sum of these multiples is 23.
 * Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
 */
```
002 | Even Fibonacci Numbers | [My Java solution](./java/src/Script002.java)
```
/*
 * Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous
 * two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
 * 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
 * By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed
 * four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
 */
```
003 | Largest Prime Factor
```
/*
 * The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.
 * What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143?
 */
```
004 | Largest Palindrome Product
```
/*
 * A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made
 * from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 x 99.
 * Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
